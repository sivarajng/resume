He has been an extremely versatile and well rounded software developer, as could be witnessed from his growth from a rising frontend engineer to a dedicated data enthusiast !! Over a period of time, he has mastered different tech stacks based on the engineering needs (ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, Java,..) along with Devops skillset. As a consequence, he has been a great asset for the Data Engineering (DE) team that requires this knowledge of cross-disciplinary stuff. I have loved his contributions in building the Data Products, containerising the Java applications and solidifying the DataOps practices within DE. Additionally, he has built lot of useful utilities (ZooKeeper Configs, Fraud Dashboard,...) for engineering (outside his work responsibilities) that has boosted the developer productivity tremendously. He is a true all-rounder and his positive attitude towards work fuels his performance further. I hope our paths cross again in future and wish him loads of luck for all his future endeavours !!',
